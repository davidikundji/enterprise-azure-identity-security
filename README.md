## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an enterprise-level cloud identity and security environment using Microsoft Azure. It focuses on Identity and Access Management (IAM), Zero Trust security, SIEM monitoring, automation, and hybrid identity integration.

The goal of this project is to simulate real-world cloud security scenarios and showcase hands-on experience with modern security tools and practices.
